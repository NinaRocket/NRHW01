First Homework

1. Corrected search-engine-optimization link by including an id to identify the element for linking.

2. Changed div to nav for navigation panel and updated CSS accordingly.

3. Added alt text to describe the images displayed where the navigation links land.

4. Created a class for the images where the navigation links land, called image-font, made the CSS code for the 3 separate images all under one image-font class. 

5. Condensed the benefits features in the CSS code, using .benifits class and .benefit-color class. 

6. Made the benefits panel an <aside> and floated right. 

7. Attempted an alt description for the background image that is referenced in the CSS. Stackoverflow said title was an option. 

8. Changed some divs to semantic tags: section and footer.

9. Cleaned up by adding line breaks in content section. Also moved some CSS code around to flow more logically. 

10. Realized I had body as first element in CSS rather than *, corrected that, my bad. 

11. Added titles to the links for further accessibility.
